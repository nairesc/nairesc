### Hi there 🍓, I'm Nuria
#### I am an Analytics Engineer at Dojo, sometimes a yogi, sometimes a salsa dancer

My background is in Human Resources but near my 30s I decided to change my career to Data, when I realised I was good with coding. I studied a Data Science Bootcamp at Le Wagon (amazing experience) and now I'm teaching data at the school. I can't define myself as a Data Analyst, Insight Analyst, Digital Analyst, Analytics Engineer, or Data Engineer... I like to work with data and if I don't know about some specific topic I'll figure it out, I like challenges and I'm not afraid of something new.

❤️  I love yoga 🧘🏻‍♀️ (exercise in general), cook 🍉, eat 🍣, read 📖 and learn new things 🤓.
